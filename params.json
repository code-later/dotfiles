It mainly\r\nconsists of zsh and Vim configuration. Feel free to use it or take any\r\nideas from it.\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer:** My main work environment is Mac OS X. I use [iTerm2][1] as\r\nterminal with 256 colors. Generally I work with a very small font. I use\r\nthese dotfile on Ubuntu servers too, but not on a daily basis. I will\r\nnot gurantee that it will work on other environments and not even on\r\nthis all the time ;-) Be sure to check any changes before just getting\r\nthe latest version.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned my shell is zsh. Be sure to change yours before\r\nusing my config. If you don't like zsh you could just use the Vim stuff.\r\nChanging the shell on OS X can be done via the Account Preference Pane.\r\nAlternatively you can switch it via this command:\r\n\r\n    chsh -s /bin/zsh\r\n\r\nTo make Vim work as expected you need Vim compiled with Ruby support and\r\nthe `--with-features=HUGE` flag. After that, clone the repository and\r\nrun the included install script:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/railsbros-dirk/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\r\n    cd ~/.dotfiles\r\n    ./install\r\n\r\nAfter that everything should be setup correctly and you can start to use\r\nzsh and Vim.\r\n\r\n### Partial Installation\r\n\r\nIf you just want to install the Vim setup or Zsh configs you can run the\r\ninstall script with a additional parameter. For instance the following\r\nwill only install the Vim configuration.\r\n\r\n    ./install vim\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of available options run:\r\n\r\n    ./insall help\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The script will _not_ overwrite existing configuration. If you\r\nwant to use the script move your \"old\" files out of the way first ;-)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nI understand that some information is not very well stored in the\r\nrepository and should be configurable on each machine. Due to this you\r\nhave some points where you can provide your own config:\r\n\r\n  * `~/.vimrc.local` -> Provide custom Vim configuration. Will be loaded\r\n  after `~/.vimrc`\r\n  * `.zsh_config_for_USERNAME` -> Provide custom zsh configuration\r\n  * `.gitconfig` -> The install script will just generate it. You\r\n  have/can provide additional information any time.\r\n\r\n### Projects Dir\r\n\r\nPointing the variable `projects_dir` to something useful for you will\r\nenable you to use the shortcut `p PROJECT_NAME`. This will bring you\r\ndirectly to the given directory under the configured `projects_dir` path:\r\n\r\n    projects_dir=\"$HOME/Documents/projects\"\r\n    $ p my_project\r\n\r\nThis will change into the directory `$HOME/Documents/projects/my_project`.\r\n\r\n### Vundle\r\n\r\nI used to manage my Vim plugins with Tim Popes great [pathogen plugin][2].\r\nRecently I discovered [Vundle][3] by [gmarik][4] and it is just awesome.\r\nYou only have to manage the vundle via git submodule by yourself and all\r\nother plugins are managed by Vundle.\r\n\r\n### Color Scheme\r\n\r\nMy color scheme for Vim is a slightly modified version of Chris Kempsons\r\n[Tomorrow Night Bright][5]. I suggest to use the same for your terminal\r\nto get the best color experience in Vim and zsh.\r\n\r\n### Fuzzy Finder in Vim\r\n\r\nCurrently the fuzzy finder plugin of choice is [ctrlp][6]. You can fire\r\nit up by hitting `Ctrl-p` (what a suprise). Take a look in the docs to\r\nfind out more about it.\r\n\r\nThere is a bunch of other stuff I use. Describing it all would take too\r\nmuch time. Just look through the single config files to get an idea what\r\nis possible. I don't use something like [oh-my-zsh][7] or [Janus][8] to\r\nkeep it more obvious what is going on.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use whatever you want for your own dotfiles. If you use\r\nmine I hope they taking you somewhere.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nI didn't came up will all that configuration by myself.
